2048 is a popular single-player sliding block puzzle game where the objective is to slide numbered tiles on a grid to combine them and create a tile with the number 2048. 
The game is won when a tile with the number 2048 is created, though players can continue to play and aim for higher scores.

## Features
- Intuitive swipe or arrow key controls to move tiles on the grid.
- Combine tiles of the same number to create a new tile with double the value.
- Score tracking to keep track of the player's progress.
- Ability to restart the game at any time.
- Game over detection when no more moves are possible.

## How to Play
1. Use arrow keys (up, down, left, right) or swipe gestures (on touch-enabled devices) to move the tiles on the grid.
2. Tiles with the same number will merge when they collide into each other while moving in the same direction.
3. The game is won when a tile with the number 2048 is created.
4. The game is over when no more moves are possible (i.e., the grid is full and no tiles can be merged).
